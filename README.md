# MachineLearningChallenge - Exoplanet Exploration

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

In this challenge machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset will be created and compared.

## Summary

### Model Accuracy
* SVM - 0.8823155822702828
* Random Forrest - 0.89433302527307
* Logistic Regression - 0.26416173946214
* KNN - K=9 | 0.828

Based on the model accuracy the random forrest model would appear to be the prefered model to be use.
